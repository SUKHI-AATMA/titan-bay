Investments in private placements, and private equity investments via feeder funds in particular, are speculative in nature and involve a high degree of risk. The value of an investment may go down as well as up, and investors may not get back their money originally invested. Investors who cannot afford to lose their entire investment should not invest. Past performance is not indicative of future performance. Please refer to the respective fund documentation for details about potential risks, charges and expenses. Prospective investors should carefully analyse the risk warnings and disclosures for the respective fund or investment vehicle set out therein. For private equity investments via feeder funds, investors will typically receive illiquid and/or restricted membership interests that may be subject to holding period requirements and/or liquidity concerns. Investments in private equity are highly illiquid and those investors who cannot hold an investment for the long term (at least 10 years) should not invest.</p>
