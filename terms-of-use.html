(“Titanbay”), an Appointed Representative of Brooklands Fund Management Limited which is authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority with firm reference number 757575. While the information on this site is believed to be accurate and reliable, neither Titanbay nor any of its officers, directors, shareholders, agents and employees makes any warranty, express or implied, of any kind related to the adequacy, accuracy or completeness of any information or opinions contained on this website. By accessing this website, you agree to be bound by Titanbay’s Non Disclosure Agreement (NDA) and Privacy Policy.</p>
                    <p>Titanbay does not make investment recommendations, and no communication, including this website, should be construed as a recommendation for any security offered on or off the Titanbay investment platform. Investments in private placements, and private equity investments via feeder funds in particular, are speculative in nature and involve a high degree of risk. The value of an investment may go down as well as up, and investors may not get back their money originally invested. Investors who cannot afford to lose their entire investment should not invest. Past performance is not indicative of future performance. Please refer to the respective fund documentation for details about potential risks, charges and expenses. Prospective investors should carefully analyse the risk warnings and disclosures for the respective fund or investment vehicle set out therein. For private equity investments via feeder funds, investors will typically receive illiquid and/or restricted membership interests that may be subject to holding period requirements and/or liquidity concerns. Investments in private equity are highly illiquid and those investors who cannot hold an investment for the long term (at least 10 years) should not invest.</p>
